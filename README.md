## Howdy! I'm Nat ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about software development and technology in general, with a particular interest in improving, streamlining, and automating processes in both real and virtual environments.

### Software
Currently, my primary focus is on enhancing the quality of the platform and services at Weedmaps while ensuring that our software engineering teams maintain or increase their productivity and delivery cadence.

### Hardware
Software is what I primarily work with.  However, I do miss the days of handling every aspect of building and providing services down to mounting motherboards into cases, installing memory, cards, drives, power supplies, etc.

Today, I scratch my hardware tinkering itch with systems on our 42-foot sailboat.  We depend on a number of systems I've put together and maintain for our "mostly" off-grid lifestyle including producing electricity, purifying water, communication, navigation, safety, etc.  The brains of her systems run on a network of Arduinos, Raspberry PIs, and a Linksys WRT3200 at the core.
